# Contributing

I really appreciate the contributions to this project, so first of all thank you!

Just make sure to read and respect the following rules before submitting a pull request:

1) Do a description of the pull request, simply following the pull request template.

2) Respect the code style used in the rest of the app (variable naming, tabs instead of spaces, position of curly brackets, etc.)
  
3) Please avoid refactoring the code, it may not be readable for you but it is for me and a refactor would make it less familiar, not to mention the time it takes to review this kind of pull requests.<br />
   If you really really want to do it (wow, my code really sucks ‚ò†Ô∏è), contact me first by email and convince me (contact.queenieeq@gmail.com), because normally 99% of pull requests of this type will be rejected, and I don't want to waste your time.
  
4) If you want to make a fairly large (more than 200 lines of code) or challenging pull request, contact me first by email (contact.queenieeq@gmail.com) to ensure that the change will be accepted, I repeat, I don't want to waste your time (for example, maybe you want to optimize or fine-tune one of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmodels but in the meantime I'm about to replace it with another one).
   
5) Once you mark the pull request as Ready for review, don't make any changes until I do my review, reviewing code is not easy, and a change would make me start over, driving me crazy üôÉ, if you think of anything else to add or change, just indicate it with a simple comment and we'll talk about it after the review.

If I don't reply to your email within 3 or 4 days, I probably missed it, so resend it or open an issue.
